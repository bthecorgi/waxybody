Love chatting with both novice and experienced riders because I love learning from others and sharing my knowledge with others. \r\n\r\nI try to work around everyone's schedules with pick-up and drop-offs before or after work. The best way to contact me is through the kijiji app messenger. \r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions you have!",
