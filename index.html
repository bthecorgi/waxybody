<p>My name is Keith and this is my 5th year offering Ski and Snowboard Services in the Mississauga area. I do all my services by hand, which <strong>elongates</strong> the life of your equipment. </p>

<p>Here are my prices for skis and snowboards: </p>

<ul>
  <li>$25 - <strong>Hot Wax</strong> and Sharpen </li>
  <li>$15 - <strong>Hot Wax</strong> only (including scrape and texture brush) </li>
  <li>$5 - Storage wax scrape and texture brush (if you sealed your equipment with storage wax last season) </li>
  <li>$10 - Minor Base repair </li>
</ul>

<p>Cross Country Ski Services: </p>

<ul>
<li>$15 - Hot wax only, scrape and texture brush </li>
<li>$5 - Glide wax (Waxless skis) </li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget to let me know what conditions/temperature you will be skiing in since I carry a variety of waxes. </p>

<p>I always look forward to swapping stories about ski and snowboard experiences. Love chatting with both novice and experienced riders because I love learning from others and sharing my knowledge with others. </p>

<p>I try to work around everyone's schedules with pick-up and drop-offs before or after work. The best way to contact me is through the kijiji app messenger. </p>

<p>Happy to answer any questions you have!</p>
